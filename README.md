# Crystal Collector Game (JQuery)

I created a game that dynamically updates the HTML page with the JQuery library. 

In this game, the user must obtain the random number dictated by the HTML page by clicking on crystals with hidden values. If the user's score matches the random number, they win. If the score goes over, they lose. 

Once a user wins or loses, the page will update with another random number. The page will also update the counter for their wins and losses.
